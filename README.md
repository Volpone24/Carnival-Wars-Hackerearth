# Carnival-Wars-Hackerearth

Problem statement

Boo yeah, it’s the holiday season again! You are visiting your folks who live by the countryside. On Halloween night, their neighbors hosted a phenomenal carnival with the greatest pomp and show. People dressed up in their spookiest costumes; families went trick-or-treating; almost everyone came together to have a great time.

For the carnival, your neighbors had set up multiple stalls for entertaining their guests. When it’s your turn to host a carnival during Christmas, you wish to promote local businesses and help boost their sales. 

You plan to unleash the inner Machine Learning expert in you and build a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts selling prices of products based on the mentioned factors.

This is the problem statement that I have worked on. This is the first time I have tried my hands on machine learning by refering to various resources.

To run this in your computer in jupyter labs, change the csv location.

Datasets - 
1. Train : To train and test our model accuracy, etc.
2. Test : Applied various models and uploaded on the hackerrank site 
3. Sample : The format for output upload.

The maximum accuracy I got was for RandomForest of 96% and for test dataset in hackerearth it was 88%.
